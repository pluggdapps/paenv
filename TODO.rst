A roadmap of things to do
-------------------------

- Automatically detect installed python version in Makefile.

- Once we migrate to python-3.3 update the Makefile for ``make setup`` and
  allow the latest version of Jinja2 to be installed. At-present the latest
  version has reverted back to ``u''`` form of using unicode-string hence we
  stick with 2.6 version of Jinja2.
